# Week-14-IP

Independent Project week 14

For this analysis we undertake a project that will inform the marketing department of Carrefour Kenya on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Our project is divided into four parts:

# Part 1
## Dimensionality Reduction
For this stage, we use customer purchasing information to do exploratory data analysis to understand shopping patterns
Nex, we use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset for easy modeling
Lastly, we give conclusions and insights of our findings
# Part 2
## Feature Engineering
Here, we use the dataset for part 1

We use filtering method and wrapper methods to select features in the dataset that explain the target variable
We remove features taht are hhighly correlated with each other
# Part 3
## Association Rule
For this part we use a dataset that comprises groups of items according to peoples purchasing behaviour(baskets)

We use the arules package to identify relationships between items in the dataset,find frequent items patterns in customer baskets and with this information advice the team on what marketing strategies to use.
All the projects are done in r
